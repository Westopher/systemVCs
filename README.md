# systemVCs

This is an app I made utilizing the following technologies: alert controllers, layout constraints, IBActions, IBOutlets,
Activity View Controllers, Alert View Controllers, Safari Services, String Interpolation, Alert Actions, Completion Handlers, 
Permissions on PList, and MessageUI.

I used these technologies to show that I can allow a user to go to a website from my app, add a photo to a photo view from the
camera and their own photo album, and also to allow a user to send an email from this app.
